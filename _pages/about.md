I'm a Ph.D student of the <a target="_blank" href="https://comp.anu.edu.au">Research School of Computing<a/> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University">Australian National University<a/>. My research on computer vision and machine learning is supervised by <a target="_blank" href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/">Prof. Nick Barnes<a/>. Before that, I received my master degree, majoring the computer vision and machine learning, from the Australian National University in 2020.

My research focuses on the trustworthiness of deep neural networks in computer vision, including the uncertainty estimation and the model calibration. I'm also interested in the adversarial robustness and the explainability of the deep neural networks.
