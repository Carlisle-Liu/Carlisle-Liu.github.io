I'm a Ph.D student of the Research School of Computing at [Australian National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University). My research on Computer Vision and Machine Learning is supervised by [Prof. Nick Barnes](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/). Before that, I received my master degree, majoring in [Machine Learning and Computer Vision](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/mmlcv), from Australian National Univeristy in 2020.

My research focuses on the trustworthiness of deep neural networks in computer vision tasks, including uncertainty estimation and model calibration. I'm also interested in the adversarial robustness and the understanding of the deep neural networks.
